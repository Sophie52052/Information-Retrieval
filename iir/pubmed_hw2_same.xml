                <AbstractText Label="Abstract" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), the autonomous variable domains of heavy chain-only antibodies produced naturally by camelid ungulates and cartilaginous fishes, have evolved to bind antigen using only three complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops rather than the six present in conventional V<sub>H</sub>:V<sub>L</sub> antibodies. It has been suggested, based on limited evidence, that sdAbs may adopt paratope structures that predispose them to preferential recognition of recessed protein epitopes, but poor or non-recognition of protuberant epitopes and small molecules. Here, we comprehensively surveyed the evidence in support of this hypothesis. We found some support for a global structural difference in the paratope shapes of sdAbs compared with those of conventional antibodies: sdAb paratopes have smaller molecular surface areas and diameters, more commonly have non-canonical CDR1 and CDR2 structures, and have elongated CDR3 length distributions, but have similar amino acid compositions and are no more extended (interatomic distance measured from CDR base to tip) than conventional antibody paratopes. Comparison of X-ray crystal structures of sdAbs and conventional antibodies in complex with cognate antigens showed that sdAbs and conventional antibodies bury similar solvent-exposed surface areas on proteins and form similar types of non-covalent interactions, although these are more concentrated in the compact sdAb paratope. Thus, sdAbs likely have privileged access to distinct antigenic regions on proteins, but only owing to their small molecular size and not to general differences in molecular recognition mechanism. The evidence surrounding the purported inability of sdAbs to bind small molecules was less clear. The available data provide a structural framework for understanding the evolutionary emergence and function of autonomous heavy chain-only antibodies.</AbstractText>
            	<AbstractText Label="Introduction" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are the monomeric binding domains of heavy chain-only antibodies that have arisen through convergent evolution at least three times (twice in Chondrichthyes and once in Camelidae, roughly 220 and 25 million year ago, respectively1). The concept of autonomous, antigen binding-competent sdAbs was first described by Ward et al. in 1989,2 and several years later, naturally-occurring antibodies lacking light chains were discovered in dromedary camels3 and nurse sharks.4 The ~12–15 kDa variable domains of these antibodies (VHHs and VNARs, respectively; Figure 1) can be produced recombinantly and can recognize antigen in the absence of the remainder of the antibody heavy chain. The modular nature of VHHs and VNARs has been widely and productively exploited in the development of antibody-based drugs (reviewed in Ref.5). Structural studies of the first VHHs and VNARs isolated6,7 provided an early indication that these molecules might interact with antigens using mechanisms distinct from those of conventional antibodies. With hindsight, the notion that sdAbs might preferentially target particular types of antigenic structures may not seem totally unexpected, given their recombination from distinct repertoires of V, D and J genes (see Box 1),8 their potential ontogeny from separate B-cell precursors,9 and for camelid VHHs, their specialized constant regions bearing very long hinge regions.10 However, the specific mechanisms of sdAb antigen recognition (e.g., the tertiary structures and physicochemical properties of sdAb:antigen interfaces, which may differ fundamentally from those of conventional antibody:antigen interfaces) remain unclear, although several studies have suggested protein cleft recognition as a general function for both VHHs11 and VNARs.12 Over time, the idea that sdAbs can target ‘cryptic’ epitopes (so-called because they are inaccessible to conventional antibodies, either for steric reasons or due to their fundamental antigenic properties) has become entrenched, and although several case studies have supported it, its generality and implications are questionable. Several excellent recent reviews and opinion pieces have alluded to the nature of sdAb paratopes and their interactions with antigens, but have either not been rigorous in their approach or have incompletely addressed the topic, analyzing the properties of sdAb paratopes only, with no comparison to those of conventional antibodies.13–17 Thus, the aim of this review was to comprehensively investigate whether and how sdAb:antigen interactions differ from conventional antibody:antigen interactions, and to assess whether VHHs and VNARs share any similarities in this respect despite their evolutionary divergence. The answer to this question has direct relevance for the ‘druggable’ target space available to sdAbs vs. conventional antibodies. </AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-domain antibodies directed against folded proteins" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">As with conventional antibodies, the bulk of sdAbs studied have been directed against folded proteins. Certain regions and epitopes on folded proteins are inherently more immunogenic than others, a concept known as immunodominance. The immunological mechanisms underlying B-cell immunodominance are poorly understood, and patterns of immunodominance probably are not completely conserved across species.29 The first indication that sdAbs might preferentially target different sets of epitopes compared with conventional antibodies came from studies of anti-enzyme sdAbs (Table 1). Conventional antibodies can act as enzyme inhibitors, most commonly by inducing allosteric conformational changes or by sterically blocking substrate access to the active site.65 It was recognized from early structural studies of anti-lysozyme VHHs6 and VNARs7 that these molecules interacted with the enzyme in unusual fashion, probing deeply into its active site using extended complementarity-determining region (CDR)3 loops. These results were later replicated independently using additional VHs,51 VHHs11,47,48 and VNARs12 directed against the active site of lysozyme, as well as with active site-binding VHHs against α-amylase,31,32 carbonic anhydrase,32 and urokinase.62,63 Inhibition of α-amylase was achieved by one VHH through penetration of the active site cleft with its CDR2 loop,31 demonstrating that CDR3-centric binding is not the only mechanism of competitive enzyme inhibition by sdAbs. Competitive inhibition of these enzymes by conventional antibodies targeting their active sites has not been described despite intensive study, especially of murine antibodies against lysozyme. Naturally-occurring competitive inhibitors of protease enzymes are convex, and this appears to be a difficult geometry for the paratopes of conventional antibodies to achieve (see below): even in cases of near-true competitive inhibition, conventional antibodies use a flat or concave VH/VL interface to bind protruding regions on enzymes and partially insert one or more CDRs into the active site cleft in a non-substrate-like manner.66,67 This hypothesis is supported by experiments using purified polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs from enzyme-immunized dromedaries showing that competitive inhibition was a feature of heavy chain-only IgGs, but not of conventional IgGs.11,32 It remains unclear why immunization with some enzymes yields mostly sdAbs with planar paratopes and bind outside the active site, achieving allosteric or no inhibition, although tolerance mechanisms may play a role. A second line of evidence clearly supporting distinct specificities of sdAbs vs. conventional antibodies can be found in studies of sdAbs against pathogenic microorganisms. Stijlemans et al.68 hypothesized that the ability of a dromedary VHH, cAb-An33, to target a cryptic glycopeptide epitope conserved across all variant surface glycoprotein classes of Trypanosoma brucei was due to the VHH’s small size as well as, potentially, the nature of this epitope. This hypothesis was supported by the inability of rabbit and dromedary polyclonal conventional antibodies as well as a ~90-kDa lectin to access this site. Henderson et al.69 suggested that recognition of a conserved hydrophobic cleft on Plasmodium AMA1 by a VNAR (12Y-2 and its affinity-matured variants) reflected a novel binding mode; although the epitope of a murine conventional antibody (1F9) substantially overlapped that of VNAR 12Y-2, 1F9 binding depended to a greater degree on polymorphic loop residues surrounding the hydrophobic trough. Likewise, Ditlev et al.70 attributed the binding of a panel of alpaca VHHs to multiple domains of the malarial VAR2CSA protein to an inherent ability of VHHs to recognize subdominant epitopes, although limited understanding of the human conventional antibody response against VAR2CSA as well as irreproducibility of these reactivity patterns by llama VHHs71 complicated this assessment. Probably the clearest examples of epitopes that are more favorable for binding by sdAbs than conventional antibodies can be found in the envelope glycoprotein trimer of HIV-1: heterologous cross-strain neutralization is extraordinarily difficult to achieve by conventional antibodies, requiring months of chronic infection and multiple rounds of somatic mutation and selection, yet cross-neutralizing camelid heavy chain-only antibodies directed against the CD4-binding site72-75 and CD4-induced sites76-78 can be easily elicited by routine immunizations with recombinant protein antigens. Similar examples can be found for other viral pathogens. Serotype cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD155-binding ‘canyon’ of the poliovirus capsid are rarely produced by the murine or human humoral immune systems,79,80 but are apparently common in llama heavy-chain only responses.81 Likewise, VHHs targeting the HBGA-binding pocket of norovirus VP1 neutralized a broad range of genotypes,82 while larger conventional antibodies also made contact with antigenically variable residues surrounding the HBGA pocket and were thus strain-specific.83 Finally, compared with conventional antibodies, sdAbs have been implied to have privileged access to recessed sites on membrane proteins,84 such as ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While this is an intriguing hypothesis, it has yet to be substantiated by any data. Camelid VHHs generated against the Kv1.3 ion channel targeted extracellular loops, not the channel cavity,85 and the epitopes of VHHs against the P2X7 ion channel were not defined.86 Similarly, camelid VHHs developed as potential therapeutics against the chemokine receptors CXCR4,84 CXCR787 and ChemR23,88 as well as VHHs used as crystallization chaperones for several GPCRs, channels and transporters,89–95 all appear to bind solvent-exposed extracellular or intracellular loops of these receptors in a manner similar to conventional antibodies and their fragments. By contrast, a synthetic CXCR4-binding “i-body” engineered from an Ig-like NCAM domain was found to penetrate deep into the receptor’s ligand-binding pocket to occupy a truly cryptic, partially transmembrane epitope.96 Thus, there is at least some reason to believe that the small size of sdAbs may grant them access to recessed regions on pores and channels, although experimental evidence is still lacking. Overall, the evidence is compelling that camelid VHHs, at least, can interact with recessed epitopes on proteins that are poorly available for binding by conventional antibodies. Additional examples of binding to recessed epitopes on proteins (clefts, cavities, crevices or grooves) can be found for sdAbs against lactococcal siphophage,97 Plasmodium falciparum MTIP,98 epidermal growth factor receptor,99 and respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein,100 although in these cases it is less clear that these sites are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. While it is possible that VNARs may share similar cleft-binding proclivities, such claims are based on very limited published data (three structures7,12,69). Moreover, it should be noted that there are many examples (not covered in this review) of partial or complete overlap between the epitopes of sdAbs and conventional antibodies, and thus the degree to which sdAbs bind cryptic epitopes vs. conventional antibody-accessible epitopes, as well as whether the magnitude of this difference exceeds more general species-to-species reactivity differences of conventional antibodies, remain unknown.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-domain antibodies direct against linear protein epitopes" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">It is generally recognized that the majority of conventional antibodies raised against folded proteins are directed against conformational epitopes (≥90%101), although this may depend to some extent on the nature of the antigen. Several authors have suggested that VHHs, at least, are even less likely than conventional antibodies to bind linear peptides with high affinity.102,103 Although this is a plausible hypothesis based on the typical structures of sdAb paratopes (see below), it has not yet been substantiated by any data. Moreover, the relatively large number of studies reporting sdAb reactivity by western blotting suggests that sdAbs directed against continuous epitopes are probably not vanishingly rare.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-domain antibody paratope structures" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The paratopes of conventional antibodies directed against folded proteins tend to be flat or concave;104 convex binding sites are difficult to achieve, at least by murine and human conventional antibodies, although synthetic conventional antibodies can be engineered to adopt such geometries.105 By contrast, sdAb paratopes can clearly adopt both flat106,107 and convex11 topologies, although possibly only inefficiently adopt concave ones. The CDR1 and CDR2 loops of VHHs depart from the typical canonical structures of conventional antibodies (Figure 2A), potentially through somatic mutation since germline human VH and camelid VHH repertoires appear to have similar canonical structures.18 Only a handful of VNARs have been crystallized, and several showed a structural class of CDR1 (H1-13–9) that is more common in VHHs than in conventional antibodies, although others had CDR1 canonical structures closer to those of VL domains. The CDR3 length distributions of both VHHs and VNARs (Figure 2B) are broader than those of conventional antibodies and biased towards longer lengths; the long CDR loops of sdAbs may be structurally constrained by non-canonical disulfide linkages (see Box 2). Despite potentially elevated somatic mutation rates (at least of VHHs), the paratopes of VHHs, VNARs and conventional antibodies have similar amino acid contents, all being enriched for Gly, Ser and Tyr, and their CDR sequences bear no obvious patterns of sequence homology (Figure 2C, D). Both VHH and VNAR paratopes have smaller molecular surface areas and smaller diameters than conventional antibodies (Figure 2E, F). However, sdAb paratopes as a group are not more globally extended than those of conventional antibodies, as reflected by the maximum interatomic distance between the tips and the bases of any CDR loop (Figure 2G).</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-domain antibody:antigen interactions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The footprints of sdAbs on antigens are smaller than those of conventional antibodies, given that the paratopes of the former molecules are roughly half the size of the latter ones. Using only three CDR loops (two CDR loops and potentially two HV loops for VNARs), sdAbs can bury similar solvent-accessible surface areas on proteins compared with conventional antibodies (Figure 3A). This is made possible by a number of molecular contacts (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges) that is slightly lower for sdAbs than in conventional antibodies, but higher on a per-chain basis (Figure 3B, 3C). Moreover, the surface complementarity of sdAb:protein interfaces is on the high end for antibody:antigen interactions (Figure 3D). Thus, sdAbs and conventional antibodies bind protein antigens through similar types of non-covalent interactions, but these are more concentrated in the smaller paratopes of sdAbs.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-domain antibodies directed against small molecules" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The dominant mechanism by which conventional antibodies interact with haptens, small-molecule lipids and oligosaccharides is by forming a binding pocket at the interface between the VH and VL domains, typically involving the bases of the CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loops.113–115 Similarly, conventional antibodies tend to accommodate short linear peptides and nucleic acid polymers within grooves formed from both heavy- and light-chain CDRs.104 Four studies have reported structures of camelid VHHs in complex with haptens and peptides (Table 2); the recognition mechanism of all but one (a methotrexate-specific VHH with a non-canonical binding site involving framework region (FR)3 residues located below CDR1113) was basically similar to that of conventional antibodies, with the hapten-binding pocket formed from two or more CDRs and extending in some instances into the former VL interface. Notably, three of these VHHs have non-canonical structures of either CDR1 or CDR2 that have not been observed in structures of other VHHs and may not be germline-encoded. Multiple studies have reported the isolation of hapten-specific VHHs without investigating their structures,119 although several also reported weaker and inconsistent serum heavy chain-only IgG titers compared with conventional IgG titers against the hapten. No studies have reported hapten-specific VNARs, and only one study has described a carbohydrate-specific VHH directed against Neisseira meningitidis lipopolysaccharide;120 at least two camelid VHHs have been described that bind to glycopeptide epitopes.68,76 No sdAbs of any type have been described that convincingly bind lipids or nucleic acids. Together, the consensus of the data is that it is probably difficult, but not impossible, for sdAb paratopes to accommodate haptens and that three CDRs are sufficient to form the binding pockets and grooves required for such interactions, although potential involvement of solubility-enhancing FR2 residues at the former VL interface in pocket formation may impose restrictions on hapten-binding specificities.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Synthetic single-domain antibodies and non-antibody scaffolds" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Fully synthetic sdAbs, derived from VHHs, VNARs or from rare human and murine VH and VL domains that remain stable and soluble outside the context of the natural VH:VL pairing, can be engineered to bind antigens using in vitro methods (e.g., phage display). More recently, technologies have been developed for generating semi-synthetic sdAbs using engineered cell lines capable of inducible V(D)J recombination121 and transgenic mice bearing either hybrid llama-human or fully human igh loci;122 in both cases, a limited set of VH, D and JH genes (some of which are in non-germline configurations to promote autonomous folding) are rearranged in a foreign cellular or in vivo system. Limited numbers of synthetic sdAbs have been described and fewer still have been studied structurally in complex with antigens. Nevertheless, the available data suggests that some synthetic sdAbs have cleft-binding properties akin to those of VHHs and VNARs51 while others employ unusual mechanisms to interact with planar protein epitopes (e.g., dramatic CDR3 restructuring of a MDM4-specific VH domain to accommodate packing against a hydrophobic helix;123 significant involvement of FRs in binding of VHs to vascular endothelial growth factor124,125 and CD40126 using distinct mechanisms). Even less is known regarding the paratope structures and binding modes of non-Ig-based antibodies such as variable lymphocyte receptors127 and non-antibody scaffolds (based on monomeric non-Ig domains such as fibronectin type III and SRC homology 3 domains), and their synthetic origin may imply that they follow no general patterns. If so, restrictions on the binding specificities of naturally-occurring sdAbs may not equally affect synthetic sdAbs and non-antibody scaffolds, although fundamental structural constraints on the amino acid sequences that can be tolerated by stable Ig folds would still apply.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Conclusions and perspectives" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Recent work on unusual antibodies produced by unorthodox model organisms (e.g., cows, chickens) has spurred renewed interest in the comparative immunology of antibody responses. Some ‘cryptic’ regions on proteins (e.g., enzyme active sites, recessed regions of viral glycoproteins) are clearly more accessible to sdAbs than to conventional antibodies. More generally, we surmise that the major advantage of sdAb recognition is the ability to target conserved cleft and pocket regions (typically binding sites) on hypervariable pathogens without making ancillary contact with the easily mutable perimeters of these sites. Why and how pathogen selection produced two evolutionarily-unrelated sdAb systems in sharks and camelids, but not in other organisms, remains to be clarified. In the case of sdAbs, privileged access is conferred by their compact paratope diameters (in the absence of a paired VL domain) rather than any global difference in paratope shape or structure. Similar non-covalent interactions mediate the binding of conventional antibodies and sdAbs, although these are more efficiently concentrated in the compact paratopes of sdAbs to produce high-affinity interactions. Although it is likely that sdAb paratopes have difficulty adopting concave geometries and recognizing small molecules, it remains unclear whether such paratope restrictions disfavor interaction with certain types of protein epitopes as well. Future studies will need to rigorously assess the degree of separation and overlap in the protein epitope space targeted by sdAbs vs. conventional antibodies, and to explore whether sdAb-accessible (and inaccessible) epitopes can be predicted in silico. Basic studies of the immunological functions of conventional vs. heavy chain-only antibodies in host defense (e.g., neutralization; opsonization; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity) would also be highly valuable. Given the apparent sufficiency of sdAb paratopes to mediate high-affinity interactions with proteins, both the evolutionary forces responsible for shaping the more complex paired VH:VL antibody system in vertebrates, as well as the overall functions of light chains, are open questions.</AbstractText>

 		<AbstractText Label="Abstract" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), the autonomous variable domains of heavy chain-only antibodies produced naturally by camelid ungulates and cartilaginous fishes, have evolved to bind antigen using only three complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops rather than the six present in conventional V<sub>H</sub>:V<sub>L</sub> antibodies. It has been suggested, based on limited evidence, that sdAbs may adopt paratope structures that predispose them to preferential recognition of recessed protein epitopes, but poor or non-recognition of protuberant epitopes and small molecules. Here, we comprehensively surveyed the evidence in support of this hypothesis. We found some support for a global structural difference in the paratope shapes of sdAbs compared with those of conventional antibodies: sdAb paratopes have smaller molecular surface areas and diameters, more commonly have non-canonical CDR1 and CDR2 structures, and have elongated CDR3 length distributions, but have similar amino acid compositions and are no more extended (interatomic distance measured from CDR base to tip) than conventional antibody paratopes. Comparison of X-ray crystal structures of sdAbs and conventional antibodies in complex with cognate antigens showed that sdAbs and conventional antibodies bury similar solvent-exposed surface areas on proteins and form similar types of non-covalent interactions, although these are more concentrated in the compact sdAb paratope. Thus, sdAbs likely have privileged access to distinct antigenic regions on proteins, but only owing to their small molecular size and not to general differences in molecular recognition mechanism. The evidence surrounding the purported inability of sdAbs to bind small molecules was less clear. The available data provide a structural framework for understanding the evolutionary emergence and function of autonomous heavy chain-only antibodies.</AbstractText>
            	<AbstractText Label="Biology of Single-Domain Antibodies" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Although no manuscripts describe the immunobiology of sdAbs themselves, Arbabi-Ghahroudi provides a historical perspective on the discovery and development of camelid sdAbs and highlights how much of the molecular ontogeny of sdAbs still remains poorly understood. Nonetheless, sdAbs have proven to be valuable research tools, especially for studying cellular biology, and two reviews summarize applications of sdAbs in fundamental research. Beghein and Gettemans review and thoroughly assess the current status of sdAbs as research tools in three main areas: (i) the preparation and use of labeled sdAbs in fluorescent microscopy, (ii) the application of sdAbs to the study of protein–protein interactions, and (iii) the use of sAbs as an alternative to RNAi in exploring protein function. They also touch on the usefulness of sdAbs as protein crystallization chaperones in structural biology. Traenkle and Rothbauer briefly review recent development of sdAbs for advanced cellular imaging (“chromobodies”) with a focus on (i) live-cell imaging to visualize the dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins and nuclear components and (ii) the advantages and challenges of using sdAbs in super-resolution microscopy. The ability of sdAbs to be expressed in mammalian cell cytosol and to tolerate fusion with a variety of tags are pivotal in these applications.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Discovery, Engineering, and Characterization of Single-Domain Antibodies" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">One methods article, one original research article and one technology report deal with new approaches to camelid sdAb discovery. Historically, most sdAbs have been isolated by selection from in vitro display libraries, yielding binders with desired properties to a target antigen. Deschaght et al. applied a next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) approach to the identification of antigen-specific sdAbs from a phage-displayed VHH library constructed from the lymphocytes of an immunized llama. NGS analysis of sdAb-displaying phage enriched after a single round of panning against RON receptor tyrosine kinase correctly identified 35 known binders as well as a large diversity of functional sdAbs that were missed by conventional screening of the same library. Hussack et al. describe the application of an anti-bovine serum albumin (BSA) VHH with unique properties (“ABTAG”) to the medium-throughput affinity screening of sdAbs by surface plasmon resonance. The authors found that sdAb–ABTAG dimers bound to a BSA surface could be completely dissociated using low pH, over multiple cycles, without loss of surface activity, and exploited this to recover rare ultra-high-affinity VHHs against CEACAM6 that were missed by panning of a phage-displayed VHH library. Eden et al. describe protocols they have developed for DNA immunization of camelids and identification of sdAbs against membrane proteins; historically, this has been an arduous and unreliable process in large outbred animal species. One original research article and one technology report describe new approaches to the isolation of human sdAbs. Henry et al. designed a set of novel phage-displayed sdAb libraries, constructed by synthetic randomization of rare fully human autonomous VH and VL domains, and provide a molecular explanation for the variable success rates in obtaining antigen-specific binders from such libraries: in the absence of solubilizing framework mutations akin to those of camelid VHHs, fully human sdAbs rely heavily on their CDR sequences both for stability and solubility as well as for binding, imposing fundamental limitations on the sequences of these molecules. One potential workaround is to increase throughput, and Drabek et al. describe an automatable high-throughput technology for isolating fully human, soluble, high-affinity antigen-specific HCAbs. Building upon a previous generation of transgenic mice bearing hybrid llama-human igh loci (llama VHH genes; human D, J, and C genes), the authors have constructed a new transgenic mouse line (4HVH) whose igh locus contains germline human VH, D, and J genes as well as human C genes lacking the CH1 exon. HEK293T cells in microtiter plates are transfected with DNA encoding HCAbs derived from bone marrow and spleen plasma cells of immunized mice and positive clones identified by ELISA. The method thus relies on the apparatus of the murine immune system to rearrange, select, and affinity mature human VH domains with good biophysical properties. One original research paper and one review deal with engineering sdAbs for higher affinity and improved stability, respectively. Tiller et al. describe a novel approach to sdAb affinity maturation involving (i) identification of CDR residues amenable to randomization by computational and experimental alanine scanning mutagenesis, (ii) conservative randomization of permissive positions with a mixture of the wild-type residue and frequent, naturally occurring residues, and (iii) screening of the resulting libraries by yeast display to identify sdAbs bearing combinations of mutations conferring ≥5-fold affinity gains. Careful analysis of each variant revealed that CDR sequence deviation involves complex tradeoffs between sdAb affinity, specificity, and stability. Goldman et al. give a good overview of the literature on engineering sdAbs for improved stability, including (i) strategies to increase the stability of camelid and shark sdAbs (e.g., through framework mutation or introduction of non-canonical disulfide bonds) and (ii) analytical techniques for assessing sdAb stability.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-Domain Antibodies as Diagnostics" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Because of their generally high stability and low cost of production in microbial systems, sdAbs have been viewed as potentially superior alternatives to conventional antibodies in diagnostic applications. One review and two original research articles focus on diagnostic applications of sdAbs. Gonzalez-Sapienza et al. summarize the pros and cons of sdAbs in analytical and diagnostic applications and review recent developments that highlight the potential of sdAbs in immunodetection technologies. Stijlemans et al. review the use of sdAbs as reagents for the diagnosis and treatment of African trypanosomiasis (AT). Current diagnostic procedures for AT are inadequate, and there is no effective vaccine; chemotherapy is the only treatment but involves high drug toxicity and increasing drug resistance. Anti-AT sdAbs have shown promise for the detection of several parasite antigens as well as for targeted drug delivery, and may even exert Fc-independent trypanolytic activity. Harmsen et al. report on their latest efforts to isolate VHHs for use in quality control of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines. Only intact inactivated viral particles are efficacious vaccine antigens but intact virus can dissociate to yield ineffective capsid degradation products; reagents specific for intact virus and broadly cross-reactive with multiple viral strains are therefore needed.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Single-Domain Antibodies as Therapeutics" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Two reviews and one perspective article on various aspects of tumor imaging and tumor targeting highlight the intense interest in the development of sdAbs for cancer therapy. Xenaki et al. provide a cell biologist’s perspective on the factors (primarily relating to molecular size and binding properties) that govern intratumoral uptake and distribution of antibodies and antibody fragments. Hu et al. review recent progress in developing sdAbs as targeting modules for drug delivery systems, including (i) toxins, enzymes, and cytokines; (ii) liposomes, extracellular vesicles, micelles, microbubbles, and nanoparticles; and (iii) viral vectors. They also discuss emerging technologies for intracellular delivery of sdAbs and sdAbs as tools for molecular imaging. Arezumand et al. review the development of anti-angiogenic sdAbs for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In the development of therapeutic antibodies, an advantage of sdAbs is the relative ease of reformatting them into more complex and efficacious molecules. Nosenko et al. offer a brief perspective on their efforts to develop bispecific TNF inhibitors using sdAbs: one arm of these molecules binds and neutralizes TNF-α, while the second arm targets the effects of the antibody to specific populations of macrophages and monocytes. Two original research articles from Ablynx illustrate the potential of linking two or more sdAbs using polypeptide linkers. Beirnaert et al. elucidated the crystal structures of three VHHs in complex with TNF. The structures revealed the molecular basis of the very high neutralization potency of a heterodimeric construct in which two of the VHHs recognizing distinct epitopes are linked by a nine residue linker: the biparatopic VHH:VHH heterodimer engages both arms in an intramolecular fashion on a single TNF molecule and blocks two of three receptor-binding sites, but only in one of the two possible VHH orientations. Similarly, Desmyter et al. developed high-affinity VHHs against IL23, and, based on the crystal structures of three VHHs in complex with IL23, rationally designed multivalent sdAb dimers with high IL23 neutralization activity using molecular linkers of appropriate length. A biparatopic sdAb-based heterotrimer in which two anti-IL23 VHHs flanked an anti-human serum albumin (HSA) VHH (for serum half-life extension) was a more potent neutralizer than any single anti-IL23 VHH fused to the same albumin binder. Three original research articles from Elasmogen demonstrate the modularity and therapeutic utility of shark VNARs. Kovaleva et al. report that anti-ICOSL VNARs selected from an immune nurse shark phage display library and reformatted as Fc-fusions markedly reduced inflammation in a mouse model of inflammatory eye disease, uveitis, when administered systemically. The observation that VNARs, but not IgGs and VNAR–Fcs, could penetrate the cornea when applied topically at high concentration raises the hope that these VNARs (in multivalent formats lacking Fc) might be useful for topical treatment of uveitis. Extending the results of Beirnaert et al. using llama VHHs, Ubah et al. isolated immune shark VNARs against TNF and reformatted them, first as VNAR:VNAR homo- and heterodimers and then as tetravalent biparatopic VNAR–Fcs. Even in the absence of structural information, the authors were able to achieve a ~50,000-fold improvement in the neutralizing potency of the VNAR monomer through molecular reformatting. Steven et al. optimized two previously humanized versions of an anti-HSA VNAR domain which had less desirable biophysical properties than the parental VNAR. After random mutagenesis of the two humanized domains and a phage display selection process, mutants with acceptable biophysical properties were obtained without compromising affinity or species cross-reactivity and extended serum half-life in a rat PK model. When fused in tandem with other humanized VNAR moieties, the optimized anti-HSA VNAR (BA11) should be useful for clinical studies. Finally, Tian et al. from Helix BioPharma describe the optimized construction of an immunoconjugate in which an anti-VEGFR2 VHH is linked to urease. The sdAb targets the immunoconjugate to tumor vasculature, where urease enzymatically converts endogenous urea to ammonia resulting in both direct and indirect antitumor effects. A similar conjugate targeting a non-small-cell lung cancer antigen is currently in clinical trials (http://www.helixbiopharma.com/).</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Antiviral Single-Domain Antibodies" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">One review and two original research articles describe applications of sdAbs directed against viruses in basic research, diagnostics, and biodefense. Wu et al. review the current state of knowledge on sdAb targeting and neutralization of human-tropic viruses and illustrate the potential of sdAbs to probe different sets of epitopes on viral glycoproteins compared to conventional antibodies. Darling et al. investigated the ability of tandem sdAb dimers directed against repetitive epitopes of filoviral nucleoproteins (“Xintrabodies” or cross-linking intrabodies) to cross-link capsid proteins and inhibit viral replication. Minimal amounts of Xintrabody ablated nucleoprotein incorporation into viral particles despite the presence of large amounts of nucleoprotein in the cytoplasm. In a companion manuscript, Garza et al. present the crystal structures of three of the sdAbs in complex with the nucleoprotein of Marburg virus, an agent causing viral hemorrhagic fever and a bioterror threat. The sdAbs bind to a cryptic epitope, a three-helix structure at the nucleoprotein C-terminus that has been conserved over 50 years of virus evolution. Engagement with these sdAbs gave the first crystal structure of the nucleoprotein C-terminus and identified an epitope that should be useful for diagnostic purposes and, possibly, intrabody-based countermeasures.</AbstractText>
		<AbstractText Label="Final Thoughts" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Single-domain antibodies, once considered immunological oddities of minor academic interest, have become critical tools in fundamental research as well as in the design of biologic drugs. Regulatory approval of the first sdAb-based drug (anti-vWF caplacizumab) is expected shortly, possibly in 2018, and may substantially alter perceptions and attitudes toward these molecules in the medical and scientific communities. The editors would like to thank all contributors for the many excellent submissions to this Research Topic, as well as the reviewers and the Frontiers in Immunology editorial office.</AbstractText>
